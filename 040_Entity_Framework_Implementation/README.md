# Entity_Framework_Implementation

This project demonstrates how to implement **Entity Framework (EF)** in an **ASP.NET MVC** application. It showcases how to use EF for data access in a clean, efficient, and scalable way. It covers:

- **Code-First Approach** – Defines models and relationships in code and generates the database schema.
- **Migrations** – Manages schema changes over time with version control.
- **LINQ Queries** – Demonstrates querying the database using strongly-typed LINQ expressions.
- **Repository Pattern** – Implements a clean separation between data access logic and business logic.
