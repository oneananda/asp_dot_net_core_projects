# 🔐 ASP.NET MVC SSO with JWT Authentication

This project demonstrates how to implement **Single Sign-On (SSO)** using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** in **ASP.NET MVC**. It consists of two parts:

- **Token Provider** – Issues a JWT token after successful login.
- **SSO Client** – Receives the token and authenticates the user based on it.
