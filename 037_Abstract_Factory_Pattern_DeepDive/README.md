# **Abstract Factory Pattern** in an ASP.NET Core Web API. 

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### **Scenario 1 PaymentGatewayFactory** :

Consider you're developing a payment gateway service with multiple providers (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay). 

You want your controller to use an abstraction without needing to know which concrete payment provider it is interacting with.

### Benefits of Abstract Factory in this example:

- **Loose coupling:** Controller doesn't know concrete gateway implementations.
- **Ease of extension:** Adding a new gateway requires only creating a new concrete product and updating the factory.
- **Testability:** Easy to unit test with mocks.
