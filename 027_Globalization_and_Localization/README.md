# Globalization and Localization

This project demonstrates how to implement globalization and localization in ASP.NET Core. It includes translating content, managing culture-specific resources, and ensuring that the application is accessible to a global audience.

## Key Features

- **Culture and UI Culture Settings**: Configures both culture and UI culture settings to adapt the application to the user's language and regional settings automatically.
- **Resource Files for Localization**: Uses resource files (.resx) for managing translations. These files store strings and other resources specific to different cultures, making it easy to add new languages by creating new resource files.
- **Middleware Integration**: Integrates ASP.NET Core middleware to detect the user's preferred culture based on browser settings, query strings, cookies, or headers, and sets the culture accordingly.
- **Localization of Views and Data Annotations**: Localizes views and data annotations to ensure that form labels, validation messages, and other UI texts are properly translated.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Easily add support for multiple languages by creating additional resource files for each new culture.
