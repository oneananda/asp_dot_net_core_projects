# GraphQL Implementation

This project demonstrates how to implement a **GraphQL** API using **ASP.NET Core**. It allows you to define queries, mutations, and subscriptions for interacting with data in a more flexible way than traditional RESTful APIs.

## Features

- **GraphQL Schema**: Define types, queries, and mutations using GraphQL.
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Fetch only the specific data needed by the client.
- **ASP.NET Core Integration**: Use the power of ASP.NET Core's middleware pipeline.
- **Mutations**: Modify data with GraphQL mutations.
- **Subscriptions**: Real-time data updates using GraphQL subscriptions (optional).
- **Support for Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**: Easily apply these features using GraphQL resolvers.
- **Dependency Injection**: Leverage ASP.NET Core's DI system to inject services into GraphQL resolvers.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The web framework used to build the server-side API.
- **GraphQL.NET**: A .NET GraphQL library for building GraphQL APIs.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for data persistence.
- **HotChocolate or GraphQL.NET**: Choose between GraphQL libraries (both options can be supported based on the version).
- **SQL Server** (or any other DB): For data storage.
