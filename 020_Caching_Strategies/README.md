# ASP.NET Core caching strategies

## Overview

This project demonstrates various caching strategies in an ASP.NET Core application, including response caching, in-memory caching, and distributed caching with Redis and SQL Server.

## Features

- **Response Caching**: Caches HTTP responses to improve performance.
- **In-Memory Caching**: Uses the memory of the application to store data.
- **Distributed Caching**: Utilizes Redis and SQL Server to store data across multiple instances.
